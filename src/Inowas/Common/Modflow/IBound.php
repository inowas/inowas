/**
 * IBOUNDâ€”is the boundary variable. One value is read for every model cell.
 * Usually, these values are read a layer at a time; however, when the XSECTION
 * option is specified, a single variable for the cross section is read.
 * Note that although IBOUND is read as one or more two-dimensional variables,
 * it is stored internally as a three-dimensional variable.
 *
 * If IBOUND(J,I,K) < 0, cell J,I,K has a constant head.
 * If IBOUND(J,I,K) = 0, cell J,I,K is inactive.
 * If IBOUND(J,I,K) > 0, cell J,I,K is active.
